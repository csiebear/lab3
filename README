Lab3
Question_A:
How to compile lab3_A:g++ -o lab3A lab3A.cpp

The program lab3A read the stdIn and get the first line get the variable n
and then read&store n lines data (the weight/heavienss)in the vector named 
weight.

And we sort the data in vector, pick up the top5 weight and calculate the 
summation.


Question_B:
We can get the execution time in the output data.
We will know the different algorithm that have different complexity can 
obviously distinct in the time.(refer the Table)
		sort()	| insertion_sort()
Size n	
1000		0	|		0.01
10000		0	|		1.28
100000		0.01|	  128.43


The algorithm having the time complexity O(nlogn) is much faster than the
 algorithm having the time complexity O(n^2).
